# Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the **Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm**, complete with a graphical user interface (GUI) for experimentation on three optimization functions using Python and Tkinter. This project is part of a larger initiative focused on **Swarm Intelligence for Function Optimization**.

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface**: Easily interact with the algorithm and visualize results.
- **Experimentation**: Test the algorithm on three different optimization functions.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: For more information about the ABC algorithm and an analysis of the results, please refer to the documentation provided in this repository.

## Getting Started
To run the application, make sure you have Python  installed and run from tinkerexp.py.
